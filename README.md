# Face Recognition with Python, OpenCV & Deep Learning
 
## Description  
This project implements real-time face recognition using Python, OpenCV, and the dlib/face_recognition library. It allows you to:  
- Capture face embeddings for a person from webcam images (via `embedding.py`)  
- Recognize a person in live video by comparing live embeddings to the stored ones (via `recognition.py`)  

## Features  
- Uses the `face_recognition` API built on dlib for face detection, embedding, and matching. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Two-step approach:  
  1. **Embedding step**: capture several images, compute 128-dimensional face embeddings, store in a pickle file. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
  2. **Recognition step**: use live webcam feed, compute embeddings of detected faces, compare with known embeddings to identify persons. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

## Prerequisites  
- Python 3.x  
- Install required libraries:  
  ```bash
  pip install dlib
  pip install face_recognition
  pip install opencv-python
